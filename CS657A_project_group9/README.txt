I have automated those installs but if any other library is missing install them by writing pip install library_name in the command line.
(for any query i am assuming there will be atleast one word which is present in the corpus otherwise my system will return no files)

The system requires GPU to load encoders.
How to run:
Upload the folder cs657A_project on google drive
The script already contains command to mount the drive,make sure the folder uploaded must have same name as "CS657A_project"
Run the "IR_Document_Retrival.ipynb"
